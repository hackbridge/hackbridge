    <h3>Hackbridge JumpStart is a hub for the development of students’ self-initiated projects. </h3>

            <p>
            Students get to work on a project based on their own ideas, not others. JumpStart aspires to be the first port-of-call when students from the University of Cambridge have an ambition to turn their ideas into reality. We provide support for students who wish to start their own company, in the form of mentorship, workshops, and exit plans.
            </p>
            <p>
            We accept JumpStart members on a rolling basis throughout the term, with two mass intakes during the start of Michaelmas and Lent term.
