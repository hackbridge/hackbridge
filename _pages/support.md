			<h2>What are we looking for?</h2>
		</header>
		<p>A long-term goal of ours is to be able to provide development resources for our hackers. We believe that providing these sort of resources helps to create <b>better projects</b> and, for sponsors, a group of graduating students who have <b>technical experience with novel tools</b> from the outset. With this in mind, we would welcome any support including (but not limited to):
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Cash funding to be allocated to particularly novel projects</li>
			<li>Computing cluster time/resources</li>
			<li>Test hardware (such as VR Headsets)</li>
			<li>Hardware components for 'maker' projects</li>
			<li>Funding to support Cluster and Aspire events</li>
			<li>Great publicity!</li>
		</ul>
