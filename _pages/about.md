			<h2>Our Mission</h2>
		</header>
		<p>Hackbridge was  born  out  of  the  experiences  of  two  Cambridge  Engineering  students  who  spent  one  year  on  the  “MIT exchange programme” and wanted to bring the “hacker” culture to Cambridge – hence supercharging students’ learning via side-projects outside of their course. We  help  students  develop  practical  skills  by  facilitating  challenging  projects  that  aim  to  create  either  novel  research  or commercial products. Since the society’s inception just over two years ago, we have grown to a community of around 70 students who’ve worked on at least one project before, with over 20 deeply challenging projects that range from Machine Learning, to Blockchain to SaaS products.</p>
