        <p><b>Demo days</b> are an opportunity to hear about the great projects our members have done! We will have
        about 90 minutes of presentations - from our sponsors, from teams and concerning our future plans and projects.
        Afterwards there will be space for networking.

                <p><b>Anyone</b>! Demo days are an opportunity for ambitious students to learn about all the interesting
                projects we do and find one for themselves. If you fall into this broad category, you'd be very
                welcome!</p>

        <h4>ARM was born out of the Cambridge ecosystem. What will you build?</h4>
        <p><b>Hackbridge Cluster</b> aims to foster the sort of collaborative environment which encourages you to build
        your dream projects. We'll be discussing current projects and your ideas for what to do in the future.</p>
        <div style="margin: 40px"></div>

            <div class="4u 12u$(medium)">
                <h3>Who can turn up?</h3>
                <p><b>Anyone</b>! Cluster is the #1 opportunity to work with ambitious (and techy) students who want
                to develop something unique. If you fall into this broad category, you'd be very welcome!</p>
            </div>
            <div class="4u 12u$(medium)">
                <h3>What is Cluster's vision?</h3>
                <p>Some of the best ideas come from these sort of environments. We're just trying to create it
                at Cambridge. Let's start building!</p>

            <div class="4u 12u$(medium)">
                <h3>How about food?</h3>
                <p>Again, we'll try to get some food + drink but it might be challenging to get the funding.
                Alternatives include chipping in a bit of cash and ordering pizza/going to Sainsbury's!</p>
