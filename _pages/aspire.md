        <p><b>Hackbridge Aspire</b> aims to motivate students to ideate, research and develop their own personal projects. By inviting inspirational industry-leaders and entrepreneurs to speak about their stories and their vision for the future, we hope to encourage Cambridge students to continue developing practical projects - in addition to learning academic theory.</p>

                <h3>How does Aspire differ from the Union?</h3>
                <p>For one, our events will not require the insane membership fee. In addition, we would love to focus exclusively on speakers from areas related to technology and/or entrepreneurship.</p>

            <div class="6u 12u$(medium)">
                <h3>Can I ask my own questions?</h3>
                <p>Yes! Ideally, we would like people to submit questions in advance so we can sort through and prioritise them. There may also be a Q&A period towards the end of each Aspire event, time permitting.</p>

        <p>It takes a great deal of hard work to arrange Aspire events. If you'd like to help us out, please look into joining our <a href="about.html#team">team</a>.
